# ResourceCollection

[Model index](../models.md) · [API index](../index.md).

This is the exact wire model. Non-nullable fields are required; field types do not imply undocumented defaults. Domain ownership, bounds and phase checks still apply.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `QualifiedId` | Identity in this model’s domain. Use the identity issued or declared for this object, not a display name or filesystem path. |
| `Resources` | [`ResourceRef[]`](../models/resourceref.md) | Structured ResourceRef value; follow its linked field contract. A bounded collection; do not assume an unbounded result or unspecified ordering. |
| `Tags` | `QualifiedId[]` | Identity or revision in this model’s domain; preserve ownership and exact spelling. A bounded collection; do not assume an unbounded result or unspecified ordering. |

## Used directly by

- [Catalog.RegisterCollection](../catalog.md#registercollection)
- [Catalog.ReadCollection](../catalog.md#readcollection)

For nested uses, follow the model links from the owning request or result. A successful decode establishes shape, not permission or business success.

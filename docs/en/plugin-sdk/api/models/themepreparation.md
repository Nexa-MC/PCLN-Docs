# ThemePreparation

[Model index](../models.md) · [API index](../index.md).

This is the exact wire model. Non-nullable fields are required; field types do not imply undocumented defaults. Domain ownership, bounds and phase checks still apply.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Theme` | `EntityId` | Identity or revision in this model’s domain; preserve ownership and exact spelling. |
| `Plan` | [`MutationPlan`](../models/mutationplan.md) | Structured MutationPlan value; follow its linked field contract. |
| `Issues` | [`ValidationIssue[]`](../models/validationissue.md) | Structured ValidationIssue value; follow its linked field contract. A bounded collection; do not assume an unbounded result or unspecified ordering. |

## Used directly by

- [Themes.Prepare](../themes.md#prepare)

For nested uses, follow the model links from the owning request or result. A successful decode establishes shape, not permission or business success.

# LaunchArgument

[Model index](../models.md) · [API index](../index.md).

This is the exact wire model. Non-nullable fields are required; field types do not imply undocumented defaults. Domain ownership, bounds and phase checks still apply.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `QualifiedId` | Identity in this model’s domain. Use the identity issued or declared for this object, not a display name or filesystem path. |
| `Value` | `string` | Payload interpreted using the accompanying or declared schema; Null is not a substitute for an error. |
| `Scope` | [`LaunchArgumentScope`](../models.md#launchargumentscope) | Explicit target scope. The Host checks that the caller is authorized for it. |

For nested uses, follow the model links from the owning request or result. A successful decode establishes shape, not permission or business success.

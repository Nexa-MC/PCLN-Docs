# CatalogVersionQuery

[Model index](../models.md) · [API index](../index.md).

This is the exact wire model. Non-nullable fields are required; field types do not imply undocumented defaults. Domain ownership, bounds and phase checks still apply.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Resource` | [`ResourceRef`](../models/resourceref.md) | Structured ResourceRef value; follow its linked field contract. |
| `GameVersion` | `string?` | Domain value named by this field; additional accepted values and bounds are determined by the operation and Host policy. Nullable; omission is distinct from an empty value. No implicit default is promised by this type. |
| `Page` | [`PageRequest`](../models/pagerequest.md) | Structured PageRequest value; follow its linked field contract. |

## Used directly by

- [Catalog.ListVersions](../catalog.md#listversions)

For nested uses, follow the model links from the owning request or result. A successful decode establishes shape, not permission or business success.

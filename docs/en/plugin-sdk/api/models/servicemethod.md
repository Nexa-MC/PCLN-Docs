# ServiceMethod

[Model index](../models.md) · [API index](../index.md).

This is the exact wire model. Non-nullable fields are required; field types do not imply undocumented defaults. Domain ownership, bounds and phase checks still apply.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Id` | `ulong` | Identity in this model’s domain. Use the identity issued or declared for this object, not a display name or filesystem path. |
| `Name` | `string` | Domain value named by this field; additional accepted values and bounds are determined by the operation and Host policy. |
| `Input` | [`SchemaRef`](../models/schemaref.md) | Structured SchemaRef value; follow its linked field contract. |
| `Output` | [`SchemaRef`](../models/schemaref.md) | Structured SchemaRef value; follow its linked field contract. |
| `Cancellable` | `bool` | Domain value named by this field; additional accepted values and bounds are determined by the operation and Host policy. |
| `Idempotency` | [`IdempotencyMode`](../models.md#idempotencymode) | Use an exact enum member listed in the reference. The Host can support a subset for a particular operation. |
| `NativeExecution` | `bool` | Domain value named by this field; additional accepted values and bounds are determined by the operation and Host policy. |

For nested uses, follow the model links from the owning request or result. A successful decode establishes shape, not permission or business success.
